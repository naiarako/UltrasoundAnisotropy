# Ultrasound Anisotropy

Jupyter notebook for estimating anisotropy of ultrasound (quasi-)longitudinal waves in transversely isotropic tissues. The experimental setup consists of a linear transducer array and a flat reflector located in front of the probe. The inverse problem is addressed probabilitically using Bayesian inference. We assume elliptical anisotropy, which experimental studies have shown to be satisified in muscles.

# Ultrasound Anisotropy

Jupyter notebook for estimating anisotropy in ultrasound (quasi-)longitudinal waves for clinical applications. The inversion is solved probabilitically using Bayesian inference. We assume elliptical anisotropy, which is a special case for transversely isotorpic media. Experimental studies have shown that conditions leading to elliptical anisotropy are satisified in muscles.

# Ultrasound Anisotropy

Jupyter notebook for estimating speed-of-sound anisotropy in transversely isotropic tissues using pulse-echo ultrasound. The experimental setup consists of a linear transducer array and a flat reflector located opposite the probe. The inverse problem is addressed probabilitically using the Bayesian inference. We assume elliptical anisotropy, which experimental studies have shown to be satisified in muscles.
